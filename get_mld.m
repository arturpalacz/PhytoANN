% Compute a mixed layer depth (MLD) from vertical profiles of salinity and temperature,
% given depth of samples.
% There are many criteria out there to compute a MLD, the one used here defined MLD as:
% the first depth for which:
%		ST(T(z),S(z)) > ST(T(z=0)-0.8,S(z=0))
% Honestly, I don't remember the reference for this definition.
% 
% Inputs:
%	S: salinity (psu)
%	T: absolute temperature (degC)
%	Z: depth (m)
% Output:
%	H: mixed layer depth (m)
%
% Rq:
%	- Absolute temperature is converted to potential temperature using the CSIRO SeaWater 
%	library function 'sw_ptmp' 
%	(You can get the library at: http://www.cmar.csiro.au/datacentre/ext_docs/seawater.htm)
%	- Potential density is computed using the 'densjmd95' function
%	- We assume the vertical axis to be sorted from top (surface) to bottom.
